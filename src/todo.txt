- rock strata in crust
- polish ufo dropping off pieces in carousel
- nicer rotating wheel
- earth desert should be more likely near equator
- adjust ufo height per planet
- implement fast graphics option
- add automatic puzzle saving
- add config file saving for settings like graphics, sound, vibrate
- stop generating ocean vertices for planets with no ocean

GLITCHES:
- piece shadow appears and lines up but actual piece never goes in and carousel is stuck
- crash/freeze when interrupting moon building process with new planet
- rendered planet without one chunk of ocean on IOS
- crashes if another planet requested while generating planet

maybe:
	- slant screen divider for one-handed ease
	- reduce opacity and transparency
