- adjust ufo height per planet
- implement fast graphics option
- add automatic puzzle saving
- add config file saving for settings like graphics, sound, vibrate
- optimize snap_to_existing function
- fix earth desert weirdness
- gas giants are too close to carousel camera
- volcanoes
- triangle normal dot gravity is cliff steepness
- planet builder
- collectibles that spawn randomly but tailored to planet
- upper limit on number of trees/other decor
- less randomness means more things to learn for the player
- icebergs
- instruments should be quieter, behind real sounds
- palm trees

GLITCHES:
- piece shadow appears and lines up but actual piece never goes in and carousel is stuck
- crash/freeze when interrupting moon building process with new planet
- rendered planet without one chunk of ocean on IOS
- crashes if another planet requested while generating planet (temporarily fixed)
- jupiter freeze
- spinning planet during new planet dialog never slows down

maybe:
	- slant screen divider for one-handed ease
	- reduce opacity and transparency
