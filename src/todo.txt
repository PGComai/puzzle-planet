FEEDBACK:
- add competition / timing
- leaving submenus should return to main menu

HIGH PRIORITY:
- splash screen

LOW PRIORITY:
- adjust ufo height per planet
- volcanoes
- triangle normal dot gravity is cliff steepness
- planet builder
- collectibles that spawn randomly but tailored to planet
- less randomness means more things to learn for the player
- icebergs
- palm trees
- planet construction animation
- add fun loading comments past loading time threshold
- try to make storms more swirly

GLITCHES:
- rotation mode glitch
