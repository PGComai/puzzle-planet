- rock strata in crust
- polish ufo dropping off pieces in carousel

GLITCHES:
- piece shadow appears and lines up but actual piece never goes in and carousel is stuck
- crash/freeze when interrupting moon building process with new planet
- rendered planet without one chunk of ocean on IOS
- crashes if another planet requested while generating planet (temporarily fixed)
- jupiter freeze
- spinning planet during new planet dialog never slows down

maybe:
	- slant screen divider for one-handed ease
	- reduce opacity and transparency
